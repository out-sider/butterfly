The 'try.py' file is a script that modifies OpenFOAM files and runs OpenFOAM.
It does such things:
	1.copies files from existing example
	2.makes dirs for mutli-parameter calculating
	3.set setFieldDict file with parameter water_percent:	system/setFieldDict
	4.modifies the gravity file with parameter g:			constant/g
	5.sets controlDict file with parameter time:			system/controlDict
	6.runs OpenFOAM to calculate for certain time
	7.does 3-6 with different value
	8.get p data from a certain face with numpy, and store them in files

You can modify try.py file on your own demand.
